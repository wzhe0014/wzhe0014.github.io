        The advancement of AI and computer technology has raised concerns about losing direction in the future. 
        AI has found applications in various fields, such as assembly line work, ChatGPT, and AI drawing. 
        This global trend of integrating technology into social development has led to the replacement of existing human roles. 
        However, the utilization of this technology also poses potential risks to human civilization, 
        as social structures may need to be reconstructed to adapt to a highly technological world.

        The term "ethical" has emerged repeatedly in the argument of AI applied in society. 
        Ethics form the foundation of humanity and symbolize love and care for others. 
        However, human nature includes elements of egoism, and rules restrict it. 
        If society fails to provide sufficient protection and support for those who are violated, maintaining humanity becomes challenging.  

        <P>Artificial Intelligence represents a new grey area in terms of rules. There is a strong sense of anger towards offensive behaviours, 
        such as using others' artworks without permission 
        and seeking copyright protection for AI-generated creations, even though they are not actual producers. 
        These users often have a limited understanding of copyright and distribute unauthorized artworks online for personal gain.</P>

        There is also a sense of fear regarding the AI technology era. Users cannot guarantee the authenticity of the information they receive, 
        and the line between reality and virtuality is blurring. Additionally, high technology raises the threshold for excitement, 
        raising concerns about whether AI could become a possible threat to society if it continues to advance.
